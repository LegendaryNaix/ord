================

Bounty #0
---------

Send an ordinal whose number ends with a zero:

✅: [1857578125803250](/ordinal/1857578125803250)

❌: [1857578125803251](/ordinal/1857578125803251)

The ordinal must be the first ordinal of the output you send.

Reward: 100,000 sats

Address: [`1PE7u4wbDP2RqfKN6geD1bG57v9Gj9FXm3`](https://mempool.space/address/1PE7u4wbDP2RqfKN6geD1bG57v9Gj9FXm3)

Status: Unclaimed (as long as no transactions have been sent to the bounty address)

Rules
-----

- Each bounty can only be claimed once.

- Find an ordinal that qualifies for the current bounty.

- Make sure that the bounty has not already been claimed by verifying that no
  transactions have been sent to the bounty address.

- Send the ordinal to the bounty address. To fulfill a bounty, the ordinal must
  be the first ordinal in the output you send.

- Send a DM to [@rodarmor](https://twitter.com/rodarmor) on Twitter or
  [rodarmor#0001](https://discordapp.com/users/336268268539215872/) on Discord.

Hints
-----

- There are no ordinal wallets or transaction construction libraries. However,
  ordinal theory is extremely simple. A clever hacker should be able to write
  code to manipulate ordinals in no time.

- For more information about ordinals, check out the [FAQ](/faq) for an
  overview, or the
  [BIP](https://github.com/casey/ord/blob/master/bip.mediawiki) for the
  technical details.

- Satoshi was the original developer of ordinal theory. However, he knew that
  others would consider it heretical and dangerous, so he hid his knowledge,
  and it was lost to the sands of time. This potent theory is only now being
  rediscovered. You can help by researching rare ordinals.

Good luck and godspeed!
