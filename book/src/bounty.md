Ordinal Bounty Hunting Hints
============================

- There are no ordinal wallets or transaction construction libraries. However,
  ordinal theory is extremely simple. A clever hacker should be able to write
  code to manipulate ordinals in no time.

- For more information about ordinals, check out the [FAQ](./faq.md) for an
  overview, the [BIP](https://github.com/casey/ord/blob/master/bip.mediawiki)
  for the technical details, and the [ord repo](https://github.com/casey/ord)
  for the `ord` wallet and block explorer.

- Satoshi was the original developer of ordinal theory. However, he knew that
  others would consider it heretical and dangerous, so he hid his knowledge,
  and it was lost to the sands of time. This potent theory is only now being
  rediscovered. You can help by researching rare ordinals.

Good luck and godspeed!
