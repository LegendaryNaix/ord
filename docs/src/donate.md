Donate
======

Ordinals is an open-source project by me, Casey Rodarmor, in development since
early 2022. I have been assisted by a ragtag band of contributors, bitcoiners,
and degenerates, including two paid apprentices. All project costs have been
paid out of pocket by me, and I have not raised outside funds, and may never.

If you so desire, consider a donation. Donations of bitcoin are appreciated,
but donations of rare, exotic, and inscribed sats are especially treasured.

Donations are not tax-deductible, refundable, or earmarked for any specific
purpose. They are personal gifts to me, made out of love, support,
encouragement, or in the vain hope that if I get enough bitcoin I'll stop doing
all this and go away.

Donations may be sold, lost, given away, or held until death. Donations of
bitcoin are likely to be spent on rare and exotic sats and making whole-block
inscriptions.

Ordinals and inscriptions are a love letter to Bitcoin, the Internet,
programming, and the World Wide Web. Money is nice, but that's not why I'm
doing it. Don't worry if you can't donate. Merely using this strange, evolving
creation is thanks enough. I love having you along for the ride, wherever it
may take us.

I have in my possession [21

Pick one that speaks to you, and send to it what you will.

Love,
Casey
