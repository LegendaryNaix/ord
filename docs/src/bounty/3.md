Ordinal Bounty 3
================

Criteria
--------

Ordinal bounty 3 has two parts, both of which are based on *ordinal names*.
Ordinal names are a modified base-26 encoding of ordinal numbers. To avoid
locking short names inside the unspendable genesis block coinbase reward,
ordinal names get *shorter* as the ordinal number gets *longer*. The name of
ordinal 0, the first ordinal to be mined is `nvtdijuwxlp` and the name of
ordinal 2,099,999,997,689,999, the last ordinal to be mined, is `a`.

The bounty is open for submissions until block 764064â€”the first block of
difficulty adjustment period 379. Submissions included in block 764064 or later
will not be considered.

Both parts use [frequency.tsv](frequency.tsv), a list of words and the number
of times they occur in the [Google Books Ngram
dataset](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html).
filtered to only include the names of ordinals which will have been mined by
the end of the submission period, that appear at least 5000 times in the
corpus.

`frequency.tsv` is a file of tab-separated values. The first column is the
word, and the second is the number of times it appears in the corpus. The
entries are sorted from least-frequently occurring to most-frequently occuring.

`frequency.tsv` was compiled using [this
program](https://github.com/casey/onegrams).

To search an ordinal wallet for ordinals with a name in `frequency.tsv`, use
the following [`ord`](https://github.com/casey/ord) command:

```
ord wallet identify --names frequency.tsv
```

### Part 0

*Rare sats pair best with rare words.*

The transaction that submits the UTXO containing the ordinal whose name appears
with the lowest number of occurrences in `frequency.tsv` shall be the winner of
part 0.

### Part 1

*Popularity is the font of value.*

The transaction that submits the UTXO containing the ordinal whose name appears
with the highest number of occurrences in `frequency.tsv` shall be the winner
of part 1.

### Tie Breaking

In the case of a tie, where two submissions occur with the same frequency, the
earlier submission shall be the winner.
